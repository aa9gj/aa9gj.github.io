title: My experience with Advanced Gene Mapping Course at Rockefeller University
---

My PI asked me to attend the [Advanced Gene Mapping Course at Rockefeller University](http://statgen.us/Advgenemap2020) and I would like to share my experience with this course. 
Overall, I am extremely happy I attended and I learned a tremendous amount of information in a very short period of time.  The course is 5 days long and is held between 9 am and 
5:30 pm with coffee and lunch breaks interspersed in between. 
* **Application**
The course is considered competitive, with a 33% acceptance rate. Scientists at any level including professors apply. I applied two weeks prior to the deadline. Application is free.
I had to write a page long statement, provide a reference letter from my PI, and my Biosketch/CV. I was notifed of my acceptance two weeks before the start date. 
* **Overall Impression**
This class is worth the time and effort one puts into it. I have revised the material on my own once I returned and was able to retain most of the concepts presented. If you do get the oppurtunity to go, **do it**.
