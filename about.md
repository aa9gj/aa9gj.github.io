Thanks for stopping by, my name is Arby and I am a computational biologist. I am currently investigating the genetic determinants of osteoporosis using big data. I will be using this website to document my progress in my program at the University of Virginia. Stay tuned for analysis tutorials, blog posts, and life updates.
